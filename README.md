# ASCII UML

There has been a trend in software development to present non-code artifact via plain text, often called ASCII.
Because ASCII has been the most used encoding, and it became part of Unicode, 
and UTF-8 has the exactly the same codes.

ASCII usage has been extended for general graphics, often called AsciiArt (see <http://asciiflow.com>, <http://www.jave.de/>) 
and UML, e.g. 
[PlantUML](http://plantuml.com),
[TextUML](http://abstratt.github.io/textuml/readme.html) ([mp](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/textuml-toolkit))
.

PlantUML is the most rich. TextUML is for class diagrams only. 
For web tool for sequence diagram
see <https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams>
and <http://sequencediagram.org> (PlantUML syntax) with additional drag-n-drop of image elements on the right side.



## Tooling for PlantUML

**Prerequisite**. For local preview you need to [download/install Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/download/).  
And possibly `GRAPHVIS_DOT` environment variable having full path and name to `dot` executable.

### IDEA

IDEA (Ultimate and CE) has Markdown plugin that can have PlantUML support enabled.
In the **Settings/Preferences** dialog <kbd>âŒ˜,</kbd>, 
select **Languages & Frameworks** | Markdown.
(https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/markdown.html#diagrams)
However that will do only sequence diagram, and all types of diagram install ["PLantUML integration" plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7017-plantuml-integration).
